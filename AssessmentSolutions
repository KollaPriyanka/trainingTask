DOCKERS 
Part A
    1. With minimal possible layers to install Web Services and expose appropriate http port for accessing:

        1. Created a nodejs app, opened a port and run it from our machine
        2. Exposed a port 8080
        3. When we build the image we use 
        “docker build -t nodeapp -f Dockerfile .”
        When we run the image , we map the port with 8080 in our local machine.
        “docker run -d -p 8090:8080 nodeapp”

    2. Docker Container is not Starting
        
        1. Check if Port is already used byanother service.
        2. Check if Docker daemon stopped working.
        3. Check if the container with the same name already exists.
        4. Check if the User does not have enough permissions to the directory.
        6. Check if proxy is not setup with docker registry.
        7. Check the storage availability in device.

PART B
    1.Using shell command search for a particular pattern (of your choice) to search Docker logs using awk command
        Awk command can be used to find a particular pattern in logs.For instance “docker logs <container_name> | grep <find element> | awk '{print $1}'” formats the logs of the container and prints only the lines containing ‘add’. 

    2. Execute a shell command inside a container to search for a file.
        To execute find command inside a running container
        “docker exec –it <container name> find / -name <filename>”
       

JENKINS
PART A
    1. There is a Jenkins pipeline failure the failure error at the outset suggest that build has failed and one of the tool used for the build is running inside the container – what are the commands you will use for debugging the issue

        1. docker stats <container id> --> when we are using any metrics, and they show how the error occured
        2. docker logs <container id> --> basic command which shows all i/p o/p and errors of a container
        3. docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash --> go inside a container and debug
        4. docker commit <container_id> my-container && docker run -it my-container /bin/bash --> if we cant really start a container
        

    2. There is a build failure due to connectivity issue with one of the tools – what actions you will take to narrow down the issue.

        
        1. Checking whether the credentials are properly configured
        2. Checing whether the required plugins for the required tools are correctly installed
        3. In case of master-slave configuration check whether master and slave are properly configured
        4. Check whether the apis written are properly working.
        5. Check whether the configured secret-token got expired.


    3. Why Docker Push fails?

        1. Authentication issue
        2. Access denied to docker hub
        3. Wrong tags being provided
        4. Docker push halts without an error because of incorrect urls/image being timed out--> restarting docker helps
        5. In the Jenkins credentials, credentials might not be added properly
        6. In Jenkins file the stage may not be correct(syntax errors) or the proper credential name not specified
        7. Directly using the login credentials, without using "with credentials"
        8. Registry URL can be incorrect
        9. Docker pipeline plugin may not be installed.

    4. Write a shell script to setup git repo, docker build, push image to docker repository.
        Clone the shell script and give executable permissions to the file
        The repository in github: https://github.com/SumaVarshitha/Trainingassessment/blob/main/Dockershellscript/dockerbuild.sh
        Give chmod +x <filename> to execute a shellscript.
